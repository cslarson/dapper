Why Arch?
arch has a tool, archiso, which makes it very easy to create a custom iso. the arch community also maintain an excellent wiki which documents how to do pretty much anything.

f2fs?

sudo rm -rf work && sudo ./build.sh -v -N dapper.iso

script downloads latest kernel which can mismatch the current os kernel causing module load issues like (kernel version directory had changed):
[Errno 2] modprobe: FATAL: Module ip6_tables not found in directory /lib/modules/4.10.9-1-ARCH

Partitioning the usb:
if it's ext[2,3,4] permissions matter, so if dapper-data created with root:root then dapper will not have write access. try your-user:users
