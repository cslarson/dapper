USB partitions + mounting, root read-only?
Updating
  load from iso for multi boot usb
  detect partition used for chain data and keys
  if no available partition detected then prompt for location?
Enable easy self build on any os
Fix quiet boot causes stick on 1sec remaining

Security Features:
  - Hardened linux kernel (grsecurity/pax)
  - App sandbox (firejail)
  - Firewall (ufw)
  - No browser ads (privoxy)
  - No admin (no sudo, no root login)
  - Minimal support packages (arch linux, openbox, tint2, xterm, chromium)
  - Runs from non-persisted live usb - replace dapper.iso to update
  - Wayland/Weston instead of X.org

Other Features:
  - Customisable
  - Optimised boot time
  - Auto-mounts separate 'dapper-data' partition

Supported Ethereum Clients:
  - Parity
  - Geth (full & light)
  - Ethereum Wallet
  - Mist

Why Arch?
  - Arch has a tool, archiso, which makes it easy to create custom iso images. The arch community also maintain an excellent documentation.

Help
  - Improve security
  - Improve usability
  - Make it look better
  - Optionally use separate partition for keys?

Check if packages need updating? From ethereum? Special flag to disallow key mounting if there's a critical issue?

Instructions
 1. + Create a bootable usb (min 1gb) from iso
    or create your own
 1. + Create a partition on another usb with label "dapper-data"
    remember permissions
    can also put this partition with bootable iso but is more involved setup
 1. + Reboot and use Mist or Parity in a secure computing environment
    remember to backup your keys!

Read-only root
No sudo
No root login
Only included packages that are dependencies for dapps or security
Grsecurity/PaX - security hardened linux kernel
Firejail - sandbox chromium and other untrusted apps if necessary
Privoxy - remove ads, additional level of browser security

sudo rm -rf work && sudo ./build.sh -v -N dapper

qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 1GB -vga qxl -net nic -usb -cdrom out/dapper-2017.04.22-x86_64.iso

script downloads latest kernel which can mismatch the current os kernel causing module load issues like (kernel version directory had changed):
[Errno 2] modprobe: FATAL: Module ip6_tables not found in directory /lib/modules/4.10.9-1-ARCH

Partitioning the usb:
if it's ext[2,3,4] permissions matter, so if dapper-data created with root:root then dapper will not have write access. try your-user:users
